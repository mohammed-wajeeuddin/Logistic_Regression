# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Weather Dataset

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a weather dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, detect anomalies, and understand the distribution and relationships between features. The analysis includes statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analysis.



## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and explore a weather-related dataset
- Identify data types, null values, and data ranges
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Visualize distributions and relationships
- Generate correlation matrix to study variable interactions

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Key Insights

- Frequency distributions for temperature, humidity, and other variables
- Boxplots and histograms to visualize spread and outliers
- Heatmaps to understand inter-variable relationships
- Handling of missing or noisy data

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Run cells from top to bottom.
3. Modify or replace the dataset if needed for custom EDA.
4. Review charts and summary statistics to gain insights.
